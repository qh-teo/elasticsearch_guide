# elasticsearch_guide
Done in Nov 22, 2017 as part of Capstone Project

Flow of how you should use the scripts:
1. loadDB
2. resultsChecker
3. scrollQuery
4. deleteDB

*You might not want to delete the database so just do steps 1-3 to get a hang of how to use the program

Folders required to create:
1. files (To store input files)
2. output (For program to store its output)
